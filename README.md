# Bikesharing_Analysis

# Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to visualize the bike sharing data that was given to us in this challenge. For this analysis we used Tableau Public in which we created different charts that tell us the lengths of time bikes are checked out, the number of trips for all riders by week, and the number of trips by users, as well as classifying it all by genders. Lastly, we used Tableau's story feature to tell the story about this data.

How long are bikes checked out for? - This graph shows us that most bikes are only checked out for 5-10 minutes max and then the graph starts trending down towards the end of the hour. Very few bikes get checkout past 1 and 2 hours marks, this we can tell because the line starts to flatten out as time increases.

How do checkouts compare by gender? - Focusing on the 1 hour trip duration side of the chart we can see that Males check out the most amount of bikes, followed by females, and lastly unknown with the least.

What are the busy hours of the day? - On weekday mornings, the busiest hour is 8AM-9AM. In the chart you can see that it is the darkest shade of color. On weekday evenings, the busiest hours are 5PM to 7PM as it is darkers during that time. One thing to note is that Wednesday is less busy during the evening compared to the rest of the weekdays. On the weekends, it is busiest in the afternoon to early evening.

What are the busy hours per day by gender? - When we compare the busy hours by gender we see that Male and Female charts have similar dark shading in the morning and the evening but for male is darker because more male check out bikes than females. Very few people are labeled as unknown in the data therefore the chart is very light in shading so it is more difficult to deduct a pattern for it.  

![Subscribers by gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95899763/162657581-e29593a8-6ee5-4614-865a-853f8a189013.PNG)

How many customers are subscribers by gender comparison? - From this chart we can say that more males and females are subscribers than regular customers as the shading on both is darker on the subscribers side. On the other hand, customers that are labeled as unknown are more likely to not be subscribers.


![Trip duration by age](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95899763/162657603-206a416b-952b-43fe-beac-b6589a1227cf.PNG)

What is the average trip duration by age? - From this chart we can see that the younger generation tend to have longer trip durations.

What are the most common starting points? - This chart shows us the most common starting points in the city of New York. The darker the dot the higher the count of starting points. The highest count was 16,564.
